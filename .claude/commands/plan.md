Follow the Cold Start sequence (steps 0-9 from CLAUDE.framework.md — the canonical list lives there; CLAUDE.md merely @imports it).

Then, acting as the project architect:

1. Do the pre-task context check. If projected >= 90%, ask user.
2. Read the relevant spec from .claude/framework/docs/specs/ (produced by /analyse)
   - If no spec exists yet, ask the user whether to run /analyse first
     or proceed with planning from the requirements directly
3. Design contracts and write them to ECOSYSTEM.md (or per-file `contracts/`, per project CLAUDE.md)
4. Break work into tasks in TASKS.md with lifecycle statuses, priorities, and dependencies
5. Record all decisions with rationale — in DECISIONS.md (or per-file `decisions/`, per project CLAUDE.md)
6. Write a plan to .claude/framework/docs/plans/
7. Do NOT write production code
8. Update STATUS.md and claude-progress.txt when done

This work is lightweight — it stays in main context. Do not delegate to a subagent.
