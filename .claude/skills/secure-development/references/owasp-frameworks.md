# OWASP Frameworks: Top 10:2025, ASVS 5.0, Cheat Sheets

## OWASP Top 10:2025 (published; supersedes 2021)

| # | Category | Review focus |
|---|----------|--------------|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Object-level authz (IDOR), deny-by-default, server-side enforcement, CORS, forced browsing |
| A02 | Security Misconfiguration | Defaults, debug surfaces, headers, cloud storage permissions, verbose errors |
| A03 | Software Supply Chain Failures | Dependencies, build pipeline, update channels — see `supply-chain.md` |
| A04 | Cryptographic Failures | Data-in-transit/at-rest, weak algorithms/modes, key management, secrets exposure |
| A05 | Injection | SQL/NoSQL/OS/LDAP + XSS (classified under injection), parameterisation, output encoding |
| A06 | Insecure Design | Missing threat modelling, absent abuse cases, design-level flaws no patch fixes |
| A07 | Authentication Failures | Credential stuffing defence, MFA, session fixation/timeout, password policy (NIST-aligned) |
| A08 | Software or Data Integrity Failures | Unsigned updates, insecure deserialisation, CI/CD artefact integrity |
| A09 | Security Logging and Alerting Failures | Auditable events captured, integrity of logs, ALERTING actually wired (renamed in 2025 to stress it) |
| A10 | Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions | NEW: fail-open errors, partial state, leaking stack traces, unhandled edge paths |

2021→2025 changes worth knowing in reviews: supply chain elevated and
broadened (was A06 vulnerable/outdated components); SSRF folded into
A01/related categories rather than standalone; exceptional-conditions
handling is new and catches what code reviews usually wave through.
Citations: cite as `A0x:2025`; legacy reports may still use 2021 IDs —
map explicitly when comparing.

## ASVS 5.0.0 (May 2025)

Application Security Verification Standard — ~350 requirements in 17
chapters; THE checklist for "is this verifiably secure", and the right
framework to cite in tenders (Top 10 is awareness, ASVS is testable).

- **Levels**: L1 (baseline, all apps), L2 (default for apps handling
  sensitive data — the sensible public-sector target), L3 (high
  assurance: financial/health/critical).
- Use chapter-wise during reviews (authentication, session management,
  access control, validation/sanitisation, crypto, error/logging,
  data protection, communication, malicious code, business logic,
  files, API/web service, configuration).
- 5.0 reorganised and renumbered substantially vs 4.0.3 — don't quote
  4.x requirement IDs against 5.0; check the published mapping.
- Practical use: pick the level per data classification, generate the
  applicable requirement list, demand evidence per item (test, config,
  code reference), and report coverage percentage honestly.

## Cheat Sheet Series

cheatsheetseries.owasp.org — implementation-grade guidance per topic.
Reach for these before inventing patterns:

Authentication; Session Management; Authorization; Input Validation;
XSS Prevention; SQL Injection Prevention; Cryptographic Storage;
Password Storage; Secrets Management; REST/API Security; File Upload;
Deserialisation; XML External Entity Prevention; SSRF Prevention;
Docker/Kubernetes Security; CI/CD Security; Logging; Error Handling;
Threat Modeling; LLM Prompt Injection Prevention.

## Other OWASP assets worth knowing

- **OWASP API Security Top 10** (2023) — API-specific list (BOLA top);
  use for API-heavy reviews.
- **OWASP LLM Top 10** — prompt injection, insecure output handling,
  training data poisoning; relevant to AI feature reviews alongside
  `eu-ai-act.md`.
- **SAMM** — maturity model for programme-level conversations.
- **Dependency-Check / CycloneDX** — see `supply-chain.md`.
