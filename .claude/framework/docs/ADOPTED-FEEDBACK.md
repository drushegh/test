# Adopted Feedback Registry

Framework-owned (manifest-shipped; overwritten on update). Newest first.

When the upstream framework adopts a fix or feature that originated in a
consumer project's `.claude/GOTCHAS.md` or `.claude/FRAMEWORK-SUGGESTIONS.md`,
the adoption is recorded here. The flow this closes: upstream sweeps
consumer feedback files (e.g. via /fleet), builds the fix, ships it in an
update — but the consumer's local entry that prompted it stays behind,
stale, describing a problem the update already solved.

**How consumers use this file:** `/housekeeping` reads it (see the
"Adopted-feedback reconciliation" step). For each entry below, if your
project's GOTCHAS.md or FRAMEWORK-SUGGESTIONS.md still carries the
matching item AND you have pulled a framework version at or past the
listed commit, remove the local entry (or annotate it
`✅ adopted upstream <TASK>`). Match on the topic, not exact wording —
your local entry is in your own words.

**How upstream maintains it:** when a consumer-reported item lands, add a
row in the same commit (or the close-out commit). Origin names the
project when known, else "fleet sweep".
