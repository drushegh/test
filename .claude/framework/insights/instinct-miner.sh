# instinct-miner.sh — mine the session transcript for repeated user
# corrections and PROPOSE candidate GOTCHAS / FRAMEWORK-SUGGESTIONS
# entries for human approval.
#
# Inspired by ECC's continuous-learning-v2 "instinct" mining, re-scoped
# to our human-in-the-loop, file-based capture model: this NEVER writes
# to GOTCHAS.md or FRAMEWORK-SUGGESTIONS.md. It only writes a candidates
# flag file (.claude/.instinct-candidates.md). The /wrapup runbook and
# cold start surface it via AskUserQuestion (approve / edit / dismiss);
# the human decides what becomes a real entry and where it goes.
#
# What it looks for: user turns that read like corrections or standing
# directives — "actually …", "no, don't …", "always/never …", "instead",
# "stop doing …", "that's wrong". These are the moments the framework
# could have prevented a wrong turn. Repeated ones (higher seen-count =
# higher confidence) are the strongest signal.
#
# Transcript resolution (first hit wins):
#   1. --transcript <file>
#   2. $CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_FILE (a .jsonl file) or $CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_DIR (a dir)
#   3. Auto-discover: newest *.jsonl under ~/.claude/projects/<dir matching
#      this repo's basename>/  (robust, platform-independent — matches on
#      the repo folder name, not a mangled absolute path).
#
# Transcript JSONL schema (characterised 2026-06-12 against live Claude Code
# transcripts, 5 files across versions — TASK-033 AC0). One JSON object per
# line; top-level .type is one of: user / assistant / attachment /
# last-prompt / file-history-snapshot / queue-operation. Only "user" entries
# matter here, and they come in FOUR flavours:
#   a. Tool results — the overwhelming majority (682/712 sampled). Marked by
#      a top-level "toolUseResult" key; .message.content[] items are
#      {type:"tool_result"}. Never human-typed.
#   b. Harness meta turns — "isMeta": true. Hook feedback ("Stop hook
#      feedback: ..."), slash-command/skill EXPANSIONS (the full runbook
#      text of /wrapup, /healthcheck etc. — these are loaded with
#      "always/never/don't" phrasing and were the 33/34 noise source this
#      task exists to kill). Content may be a string OR an array.
#   c. Sidechain turns — "isSidechain": true on every entry of a subagent
#      transcript (stored under <session>/subagents/). Their "user" turns
#      are orchestrator prompts, not the human.
#   d. Genuine human turns — none of the above markers; content is an array
#      of {type:"text"} items (a plain string in older entries). Even here,
#      individual text items can be harness-INJECTED context rather than
#      typed text: "<ide_opened_file>...", "<ide_selection>...",
#      "<system-reminder>..." blocks, "<command-name>..." (legacy command
#      echo). Tag-prefixed items are dropped; <system-reminder> ranges and
#      fenced ``` blocks (pasted file/log content) are stripped line-wise.
# NOT usable as a discriminator: "promptSource" ("sdk") — only stamped by
# newer Claude Code versions; 16/26 sampled genuine human turns lack it.
#
# Config:

#   INSTINCT_MIN_CONFIDENCE (default 1) — drop candidates seen fewer than N times.
