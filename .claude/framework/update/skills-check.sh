#!/usr/bin/env bash
# skills-check.sh — checks the skills upstream for newer content than the
# project's pinned SHA, and notifies if the project's selected skills are
# behind (TASK-043). Completes the skills-sync loop: skills-sync.sh pulls,
# this tells you when there's something to pull.
#
# Runs as part of cold start (alongside check-updates.sh). Silent when the
# project hasn't opted into skills (no .skills-version) or is up to date.
# When behind, writes .claude/.skills-update-available.md for the session
# to surface and offer to run skills-sync.sh.
#
# Mirrors check-updates.sh deliberately — same throttle, same DA-C4 flag
# discipline (the flag is a pending notification: never deleted up front,
# survives throttled runs and network failures, cleared only by a live
# up-to-date check).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — up to date / behind (flag written) / throttled / not opted in
#   2  — .skills-version present but malformed
#   3  — network failure (ls-remote unreachable) — flag left intact
#
# Dependencies: git, date. No jq, no curl.

# Skills Available for This Project

This project's stack matches skills in the CCMAF skills catalogue, but
skills sync is not set up here. Skills give the agent senior-level,
domain-specific engineering standards (loaded only when relevant).

- **Detected stack suggests:** $names
- **Cross-cutting (always worth considering):** secure-development, accessibility-development

## To set up

Create \`.claude/.skills-version\`:

    SKILLS_UPSTREAM_URL=git@github.com:drushegh/CCMAF---Skills.git
    SKILLS_UPSTREAM_BRANCH=main
    SKILLS_PINNED_SHA=
    SKILLS_SELECTED="$names"

then run: \`bash .claude/framework/update/skills-sync.sh\`

## Not now

Delete this file: \`rm .claude/.skills-suggestion.md\`
(Re-suggested after $SKILLS_SUGGEST_INTERVAL_DAYS days.)

## Never for this project

\`touch .claude/.skills-declined\` and COMMIT it (it's a project
decision every clone should see), then delete this file.

# Skills Update Available

The skills upstream has new content since this project last synced.

- **Pinned:** \`$pinned_short\`
- **Latest:** \`$latest_short\`
- **Upstream:** $SKILLS_UPSTREAM_URL ($SKILLS_UPSTREAM_BRANCH)
- **Selected skills:** ${SKILLS_SELECTED:-(none selected)}

## To update

Run: \`bash .claude/framework/update/skills-sync.sh\`

This re-syncs the skills named in \`SKILLS_SELECTED\` (in
\`.claude/.skills-version\`) from the upstream above. Skills you have NOT
selected are untouched; local skill dirs are never touched.

To add a skill that's new upstream, add its dir name to \`SKILLS_SELECTED\`
first (\`skills-sync.sh --suggest\` lists names matching this project's stack),
then run the sync.

## To skip

Delete this file: \`rm .claude/.skills-update-available.md\`
The next cold start re-checks after the throttle interval
(\`SKILLS_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS\`, default 24h).
