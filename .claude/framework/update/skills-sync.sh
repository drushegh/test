#!/usr/bin/env bash
# skills-sync.sh — selectively sync language/topic skills from a separate
# skills repo into .claude/skills/ (TASK-036; contract:skills-sync).
#
# A SECOND upstream, independent of the framework upstream: the skills
# repo has one directory per skill (SKILL.md + optional reference files).
# A project declares which skills it wants in .claude/.skills-version;
# this script clones the skills upstream and copies ONLY those dirs.
# Ownership is per-directory: selected dirs belong to the skills repo
# (overwritten on sync, after a dirty-check); everything else under
# .claude/skills/ is consumer-local and never read, written, or deleted.
# Neither apply-update.sh nor framework-manifest.txt touches skills.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .claude/framework/update/skills-sync.sh             # sync selected skills
#   bash .claude/framework/update/skills-sync.sh --suggest   # stack-detect suggestions only
#
# .claude/.skills-version (project-owned, sourceable shell):
#   SKILLS_UPSTREAM_URL=git@github.com:you/your-skills.git   # any git-clonable URL or local path
#   SKILLS_UPSTREAM_BRANCH=main
#   SKILLS_PINNED_SHA=<rewritten by this script on successful sync>
#   SKILLS_SELECTED="python rust"                            # skill dir names, space-separated
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — synced (or nothing to do / --suggest)
#   1 — one or more selected skills refused (uncommitted local changes)
#   2 — setup issue (.skills-version missing or malformed)
#   3 — network/clone failure
#
# Dependencies: git. No jq, no curl.
